#Task 1

#A bubble sort can be modified to “bubble” in both directions.
#The first pass moves “up” the list and the second pass moves “down.” 
#This alternating pattern continues until no more passes are necessary.
#Implement this variation and describe under what circumstances it might be appropriate.

 

#Task 2

#Implement the mergeSort function without using the slice operator.

 

#Task 3

#One way to improve the quicksort is to use an insertion sort on lists that are small in length (call it the “partition limit”). 
#Why does this make sense? Re-implement the quicksort and use it to sort a random list of integers.
#Perform analysis using different list sizes for the partition limit.
